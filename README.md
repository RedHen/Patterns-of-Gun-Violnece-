# Patterns-of-Gun-Violnece-
Looking to address the social barriers killing so many in Philadelphia. Would like to see if we can build AI that helps give light to gun violence from street soldier's perspectives. There are various roadblocks in communities of philadelphia that have traditionally been neglected for another community gain. In the 20 plus years that i have been a family community advocate, i have learned about variables that contribute to gun violence. Variables like communities with natural settings versus abandon row homes, public resources versus privatization, homeowners associations versus developers planning communities. As a member of Philly Truce, i would also like to highlight the economic crisis driving patterns of gun violence.
