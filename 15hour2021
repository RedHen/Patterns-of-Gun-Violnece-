We, students and alumni of your university, have assembled today as the #MillionStudentMarch to call upon you to address a moral crisis. American higher education is being commodified on an intolerable scale. Soaring tuition and student debt levels (over $1 trillion nationwide) are reinforcing financial inequalities of access to higher learning. Unlivable wages offered to student workers and adjunct professors are driving poor and working class students out of academia while campus workers struggle to afford to send their children to the universities their labor sustains. Urban private universities are becoming “mega-nonprofits” while the cities they reside in see their budgets starved and public education subject to a crippling austerity, and predominantly working-class and non-white community residents are displaced by the gentrification wrought by expansion, construction and an influx of affluent, transient student-residents. We believe that these issues are as relevant and serious at Penn as at other universities rallying today across the country, and this is why we are making the following 3 demands: for the Board of Trustees to form a committee to immediately and transparently work to reduce our university’s exorbitant tuition rates, reduce debt burdens and extend financial aid to your students, especially poor students and students of color; to enact a truly livable $15 minimum wage across campus; and to pay PILOTs to the City of Philadelphia to fund our city’s ailing K-12 public schools.

2021 Conversations of concerns for tution hikes by Penn students reveal their disappointment with increase tution being they are at home taking classes online. 
The University of Pennsylvania will raise tuition 2.8% next year, which the Ivy League institution is touting as its lowest percentage increase since the 1960s.
Total cost for tuition, fees, and room and board will exceed $79,000 for 2021-22, up $2,188 from the current year. Tuition will rise to $54,652, fees to $7,058, housing costs to $11,358, and dining to $5,946, under a plan approved by the board of trustees Thursday afternoon.
“The moderate increase in charges was determined through careful consideration of the impact of the pandemic on students and their families as well as the ongoing financial challenges confronting the University,” Trevor Lewis, vice president for budget planning and analysis, said in a statement.

In each of the last two years, tuition has risen 3.9%.
Some colleges and universities have frozen tuition and other costs or even cut them in the last year, given the economic effects of the pandemic and the fact that much learning is taking place remotely. Both Immaculata and Cabrini Universities announced in October they would freeze tuition, fees, and room and board for 2021-22.

Penn noted that 46% of its undergraduates receive grant-based financial aid from the university, with an average of $55,861. And students from families with incomes less than $65,500 and typical assets get aid that covers tuition, fees, and room and board, the school said.
